I am currently a PHD student in the <a href="https://infrastructure.eng.unimelb.edu.au/">Department of Infrastructure Engineering</a> , Faculty of Engineering and IT; mainly working with the <a href="https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/thus">Transport, Health and Urban Systems (THUS) research lab</a>, Melbourne School of Design.

I am using computer vision, machine learning to quantify infrastructures and map them with air pollutants or GHG emissions, in an effort to tackle the urgent climate crisis with all interested parties.
