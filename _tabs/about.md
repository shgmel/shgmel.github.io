I am currently a PHD student in the <a href="https://infrastructure.eng.unimelb.edu.au/">Department of Infrastructure Engineering</a> , Faculty of Engineering and IT; mainly working with the <a href="https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/thus">Transport, Health and Urban Systems (THUS) research lab</a>, Melbourne School of Design.

I am using computer vision, machine learning to quantify infrastructures and map them with air pollutants or GHG emissions, in an effort to tackle the urgent climate crisis with all interested parties.

Why do I need a website?

I always had little interest in advertising or promoting my job or study, but I also realized I need resources to support my work and make it sustaintable. To me, the most important resource is people, I was fortunate to be helped or supported by a lot of amazing people all along, even if I was very seletive to keep only a small fraction around. So that I need occationally to expand the base to be selected from.

Attending the FEIT showcase event is a step towards a larger base, some people asked how to find you. Back from the event, I searched my name on google. Besides a Linkedin page, only another one is relevant to me, which is really <a href="https://mothlight.github.io/">Nice</a>, then I think I need my own one.
